Welcome to Astrapia's documentation!
====================================

*Astrapia* is a Python framework for comparing and evaluating tabular post-hoc explainers.
Explainers can be used to understand hte behaviour of modern opaque and intransparent machine learning models. 
Still, some explainer are better than others. This framework is designed to compare them using a generalised set of metrics.

Astrapia is **not** a framework for ranking explainers. It barely aids users in judging advantages and disadvantages of different explainers.
